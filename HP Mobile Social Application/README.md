# About CyberPunk Social Media app

This was a personal project of mine where I envisioned an app solely used by people who work in the tech sector. I designed this app with a cyberpunk theme to practice my skills. One inspiration I drew this app from was Instagram. I also drew inspiration from Facebook and I would like to give a shoutout to [Howard Pinsky videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBTfHoxFa9o&list=PLuQZzG-z6zBLRfR_XKO0QbRwqlWKYPgyc&pp=iAQB) for also being one of biggest sources of inspiration for this project.

Here is an overview of how the wireframe and UI of my XD file looks like

Documents in this project consist of:
- **<ins>For export</ins>** folder that consist of the images from the artboards I used in my xd file (unfortunately I am unable to upload the xd file as the file size is over the Github file upload limit of 100MB).
- Remaining folder are images I used from unsplash.
