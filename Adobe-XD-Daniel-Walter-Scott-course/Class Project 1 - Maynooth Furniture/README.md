# About Maynooth Furniture Project

In this project, I was tasked with creating a website and app UI/UX for a client (not real) called Katherine, who owns Maynooth Furniture. This is a new business selling affordable high-end design furniture made in Ireland.

Primary objectives:
- To build a e-commerce website for people to browse & purchase furniture for home delivery.

As you can see below here is how the app and website roughly works. Here is a video to show how the Maynooth app works. If you are curious please visit this link:
