# About Roar Cycles Project
In this project, I was tasked with creating a website UI/UX for a client (not real) for a client called Jake, who cycles to work and wants his bicycle to be practical but unique. The company that best accomplishes this is Roar Bikes. This is a manufacturer of small run, contemporary bicycles sold exclusively from their own website. Roar Bikes currently have 3 models of bike to purchase (Siamese, Sphynx, Bengal)

Primary objectives:

To build a e-commerce website for people to browse & purchase.

If you click on the link, it shows roughly how the website works:

About the documents are folders:

- **<ins>Assignment 11.xd</ins>** is the Adobe XD file that contains both the app and website UI/UX.
- **<ins>Brief - Roar Bikes.pdf</ins>** contains the assignment expectations and deliverables
- **<ins>Persona - Roar Bikes.pdf</ins>** contains the description of the client such that I can emphatise with them and put myself in their shoes.
- **<ins>Logos</ins>** folder contains the logos and icons of Roar Bikes I am expected to use in my final deliverable.
- **<ins>Roar Cycles Export website</ins>** folder contains all the artboards used in the formation of the UI/UX of the website
- Unfortunately I am unable to upload the XD file as the file size is incredibly big at over 100MB which exceeds Github's file upload limit.
